# Abstract
 Drinking water transportation by tankers are SOS arrangements. Their real time, GIS based tracking right from filling to decanting would prevent the misuse
  Android app and Arduino code for RTTMS by team Magnètè Bit
 # Description
 Camera and GPS features of Tanker drivers smart phone can be used with the help of mobile app to track tankers movements and decanting. This will save cost of GPS trackers, batteries. The contractor keep on hiring different tankers as need arises. Problem of changing GPS devices will be eliminated. Some techniques(may be radio-frequency identification-RFID) is further required to connect tanker drivers smart phone and the tanker attached with tractor.
 We've implemented an array of ultrasonic sensors to moniter the water level on real time and send the data to Driver's phone and the data is futher uploaded on central server for real time monitering of the waterlevel of the tank.
